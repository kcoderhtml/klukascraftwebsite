You access your MinigalNano exclusively with firefox >v26 (for example 
on your home server)?

If you apply this patch, the images in the lightbox are properly rotated 
by the browser itself using the information from the EXIF data.

To fit the images, I made the lightbox squared so there are white 
stripes either on the sides or the top and the bottom.
